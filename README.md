This is a library of useful utility functions for Coq plugins. These functions originally come from [PUMPKIN PATCH](https://github.com/uwplse/PUMPKIN-PATCH) and [DEVOID](https://github.com/uwplse/ornamental-search), but may be useful for plugin development more broadly.

As of July 23rd, 2019, these functions still use poor practice for a lot of functions from the Coq standard library, so there are no guarantees on behavior yet. This will be fixed by the time PUMPKIN PATCH 0.1 is released, and this note will be removed.
